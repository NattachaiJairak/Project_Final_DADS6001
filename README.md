# Advertising Campaign CTR Analysis

## Scenario:
I work for a marketing company, and my team has developed a new advertising campaign aimed at increasing the click-through rate (CTR) for a client's website. The current industry average CTR is known to be 17.43%.

My client is interested in knowing whether the new campaign has been effective in increasing the CTR for their website. To evaluate this, I collect data on the number of clicks generated by the new campaign out of the total number of impressions it received over a certain period.

## Dataset:
I collect data for a sample of 16,468,027 impressions generated by the new campaign, and I find that 5,947,563 of them resulted in clicks.

## Hypothesis:
My null hypothesis \( H_0 \) is that the proportion of clicks generated by the new campaign is equal to the industry average CTR of 17.43%.

The alternative hypothesis \( H_1 \) is that the proportion of clicks generated by the new campaign is greater than 17.43%.
## Analysis:
```R
# Sample data
impressions <- 16468027
clicks <- 5947563
industry_ctr <-  0.1743  # Industry average CTR
significance_level <- 0.05

# Perform proportion test
result <- prop.test(x = clicks, n = impressions, p = industry_ctr, alternative = "greater")

# Extract p-value from the test result
p_value <- result$p.value

# Output the test result
print(result)

# Compare p-value to significance level
if (p_value < significance_level) {
  cat("Reject the null hypothesis. The new campaign's CTR is significantly different from the industry average.\n")
} else {
  cat("Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the new campaign's CTR is significantly different from the industry average.\n")
}
```
